# `poly_l10n`

Handle locali(s|z)ations the correct way.

There are many i18n libraries out there that doesn't do this right: language fallbacks.
Unfortunately most projects (regardless of whether or not it's open source) do not support all
languages. This library fixes this for you with [`LocaleFallbackSolver`].

Additionally this library provides helper functions for figuring out the user language preference.
See [`system_want_langids`].
